Problem Description
Given eight integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H which represent two rectangles in a 2D plane.

For the first rectangle it's bottom left corner is (A, B) and top right corner is (C, D) and for the second rectangle it's bottom left corner is (E, F) and top right corner is (G, H).

Find and return whether the two rectangles overlap or not.



Problem Constraints

    -10000 <= A < C <= 10000

    -10000 <= B < D <= 10000

    -10000 <= E < G <= 10000

    -10000 <= F < H <= 10000 



Input Format

The eight arguments given are the integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H.


Output Format

Return 1 if the two rectangles overlap else return 0.


Example Input

Input 1:

A = 0   B = 0
C = 4   D = 4
E = 2   F = 2
