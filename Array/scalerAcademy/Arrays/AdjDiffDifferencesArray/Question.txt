Adjacent Differences Array

Get help from TA

Problem Description

You are given an integer array A having N integers.

You have to construct and return an array containing all the adjacent / consecutive element differences (A[i + 1] - A[i]) in the same order.



Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

First and only argument is an integer array A.


Output Format

Return an integer array.


Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [6, 2, 4, 4, 3]

Input 2:

 A = [2]



Example Output

Output 1:

 [-4, 2, 0, -1]

Output 2:

 []



Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 A[1] - A[0] = 2 - 6 = -4
 A[2] - A[1] = 4 - 2 = 2
 A[3] - A[2] = 4 - 4 = 0
 A[4] - A[3] = 3 - 4 = -1 
 âˆ´ Result Array = [-4, 2, 0, -1]

Explanation 2:

 As there is only one element in the array, there are no adjacent element pairs. So, an empty integer array is returned.
